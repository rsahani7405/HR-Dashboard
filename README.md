## HR Dashboard Project

This project showcases an interactive **HR Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to analyze key employee metrics, such as distribution, performance, and attrition. The dataset was initially in **CSV format**, and I applied various transformations and calculations to derive meaningful insights.

### Key Features:
- **Data Transformation:** Imported and cleaned the CSV data using **Power Query**. This included correcting column inconsistencies and formatting issues to prepare the data for analysis.
  
- **Conditional Columns:** Created conditional columns to classify employees based on promotion eligibility and performance ratings, helping to quickly identify high and low performers.

- **Dedicated Measures Table:** All key metrics (e.g., Total Employees, Attrition Rate, etc.) were calculated using **DAX** formulas and organized into a **separate measures table** for easier management.

### Dashboard Overview:

- The dashboard features key metrics such as:
  - **Total Employees**
  - **Gender Distribution**
  - **Attrition Rate**
  - **Job Role Statistics**
  - **Average Monthly Income by Job Role**
  - **Employee Satisfaction and Job Levels**

### Visual Insights:
- Total Employees: 1470 (60% Male, 40% Female)
- Employee distribution by **job role, education field**, and **service years**
- **Employee satisfaction levels** and **attrition rates**
- A detailed analysis of **average monthly income by job role**
- Drill-down functionality for in-depth analysis by gender and department.

### Dashboards:
The project contains two main dashboards:
1. **Home Dashboard:** Focuses on overall employee metrics, ratings, and attrition.
2. **Job Dashboard:** Highlights employees due for promotion, job satisfaction, and attrition details.

These dashboards provide HR teams with a data-driven approach to **workforce planning** and **decision-making**, enabling better insights into employee performance and trends.
